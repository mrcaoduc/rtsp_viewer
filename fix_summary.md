# RTSP Viewer - Fix Summary

## Problem
Your original code was hanging when changing the grid layout because heavy operations were being performed synchronously in the main GUI thread.

## Root Cause
When the user changed the grid size dropdown, the `change_grid_size()` method would:
1. Acquire a mutex lock in the main GUI thread
2. Call `update_streams()` which performed heavy blocking operations:
   - Stopping VLC players with `time.sleep(1.0)`
   - Network connectivity checks (2-second timeouts per URL)
   - VLC player creation and starting
3. All this blocked the main thread for 5-15+ seconds, making the GUI completely unresponsive

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **Worker Thread for Heavy Operations**
- Created `StreamUpdateWorker` class that inherits from `QThread`
- Moved all heavy operations (VLC player management, network checks) to background thread
- Main GUI thread remains responsive during stream updates

### 2. **Removed Mutex from GUI Thread**
- Eliminated `QMutex` usage in main GUI thread signal handlers
- Used `self.updating` flag to prevent concurrent operations
- Mutex is no longer needed since heavy work is in separate thread

### 3. **Asynchronous Layout Changes**
```python
def change_grid_size(self, text):
    if self.updating:
        return
    # ... lightweight operations only ...
    # Defer heavy work using QTimer
    QTimer.singleShot(0, lambda: self.start_stream_update('\n'.join(self.rtsp_urls)))
```

### 4. **Parallel Network Checking**
- Used `ThreadPoolExecutor` to check multiple RTSP URLs simultaneously
- Instead of sequential 2-second checks, now all URLs are checked in parallel

### 5. **Progressive UI Updates**
- Added progress bar and status label to show operation progress
- Controls are disabled during updates to prevent user confusion
- Stream configuration happens progressively via signals

### 6. **Graceful Player Management**
- Players are stopped immediately but released after a delay using `QTimer`
- No more blocking `time.sleep()` calls in main thread
- Better error handling for VLC operations

### 7. **User Experience Improvements**
- Added visual feedback (progress bar, status messages)
- Prevent multiple concurrent operations
- Cleaner shutdown process

## Benefits of the Fixed Version

1. **No More GUI Freezing**: Layout changes are now smooth and responsive
2. **Better Performance**: Network checks happen in parallel
3. **Visual Feedback**: Users can see progress of operations
4. **Error Prevention**: Multiple operations are prevented
5. **Cleaner Code**: Separation of concerns between GUI and heavy operations

## Usage Notes

- The application now shows "Ready" status when idle
- A progress bar appears during stream updates
- Controls are temporarily disabled during operations to prevent conflicts
- Error messages are more descriptive and user-friendly

The fixed version maintains all original functionality while eliminating the GUI hanging issue through proper thread management and asynchronous operations.
